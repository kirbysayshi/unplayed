# Unplayed

Keep a list of games, using only Github Pages as storage. The goal is to allow editing from anywhere (mobile device, laptop) in a browser, and without needing a backend. See it live: https://kirbysayshi.com/unplayed.

Built using TypeScript-powered ESModules. So far, no bundler.

## Usage

Tap and hold an entry to edit it. Or press "Add Game". Then copy/paste the data into the TOP of [games.js](./games.js) on github and hit save!

## Attribution

This is Shaun Inman's idea, and basically his design as well. See https://shauninman.com/unplayed/ and https://shauninman.com/archive/2011/04/18/unplayed.
