# Unplayed

Keep a list of games, using only Github Pages as storage (no build!). See an example: https://kirbysayshi.com/unplayed.

This is a github template, so you can make your own by clicking the template button!

## Usage

Edit games.js to add games. Also edit the `About()` call to add your own flair.

There is a "Mobile Editor" at the bottom that will help prepare the calls more easily than manually typing them into Github's browser code editor. But you'll still have to copy/paste the result in manually. Anyone have a better idea? Trying to avoid servers...
